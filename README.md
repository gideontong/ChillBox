# ChillBox
ChillBox is a food classifier for use with smart fridges. Or at least, that's what it was supposed to be. It was written in approximately 10 minutes at Hard Hacks 2020 by Gideon Tong and Brian Lam.

If you have questions, you should probably leave this repo alone and make your own which should be better. It is archived for posterity but does not serve any real purpose. The idea may be reused in a future hackathon to create a better, well-designed and polished project instead.
